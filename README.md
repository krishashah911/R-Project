# ðŸ“Œ About
This R project encompasses a comprehensive suite of data analysis and visualization tasks. It begins with data importation from various sources (CSV, Excel, databases, APIs), followed by extensive data cleaning and wrangling using packages like dplyr and tidyr. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted with summary statistics and visualizations via ggplot2 and plotly to uncover patterns and outliers. The project includes robust statistical analysis such as hypothesis testing, regression, and time series analysis. Interactive dashboards and reports are generated using Shiny and R Markdown to facilitate data storytelling. The project also involves connecting to databases, performing SQL queries, and ensuring reproducibility through documented workflows and version control with Git. Specialized analyses, such as bioinformatics and financial modeling, demonstrate the project's versatility, leveraging R's extensive ecosystem to deliver insightful and actionable results.

This repository is continuously updated with new projects and improvements. Feel free to contribute, fork, or reach out if you have questions!
