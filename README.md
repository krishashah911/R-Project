# Project 2: NYC COVID-19 Data Analysis
This project analyzes COVID-19 data for NYC zip codes and daily state-level statistics using the ggplot2 package for visualization.

# Key Analyses & Insights:
1. Zip Code Distribution – A bar graph showed that Queens had the highest number of zip codes.
2. COVID Cases by Zip Code – A histogram visualized the distribution of COVID cases, highlighting high case counts in certain zip codes.
3. Boxplots of Testing Data – Showed variations in total COVID tests conducted across boroughs.
4. Scatter Plots – Several scatter plots analyzed relationships between cases, deaths, and test positivity rates, revealing borough-specific trends.
5. Time Series Analysis – A plot of daily cases and deaths illustrated trends over time, with peaks aligning with known COVID surges.
6. NYC Total Cases & Population – The total number of cases and NYC population were computed.
7. Borough-Specific Case Statistics – Summary statistics were extracted for Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island separately.
8. Highest Case Rate – Identified the NYC zip code with the highest case rate.
9. Death-to-Hospitalization Ratio – Found the date with the highest proportion of deaths relative to hospitalizations in NY State.

# Main Takeaways:
COVID cases varied significantly by borough, with Queens having the most affected zip codes.

Scatter plots suggested a correlation between high case counts and death rates in some boroughs.

Temporal trends reflected key COVID waves, aligning with policy changes and public health interventions
