# Project 4: Exploratory Data Analysis of Weekly Shopping Dataset (CI7330)
This project explores a manually created dataset containing key features related to weekly shopping activities. The dataset includes variables such as the amount spent, queue time, family size, store type, shopping type, and household income. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to summarize the data, uncover relationships, and visualize insights that are easily understandable, even for a general audience.

# Key Analyses & Insights:
- **Descriptive Statistics:** The dataset was analyzed using descriptive statistics for both quantitative and categorical variables.

    For quantitative variables (e.g., spend, queue time, family size, and income), the summary statistics were presented.
  
    For categorical variables (e.g., store and shop type), frequency counts were provided, showing the distribution of store types (rural, city centre, urban) and shopping methods (instore, online collection, online home delivery).
  
- **Single Variable Visualization:** The distribution of household sizes was visualized, showing that the majority of households had 3-5 members, while fewer households had more than 5 members.

- **Relationship Between Variables:** The relationship between income and spending was explored through scatter plots, which showed no clear linear correlation between the two variables. People with similar household incomes (e.g., 40,000 or 50,000) spent similarly, suggesting no significant direct relationship.
  
- **Hypothesis Testing:** A hypothesis test was conducted to evaluate whether there was a significant relationship between income and spending. The results indicated a positive relationship, with higher income correlating with higher spending levels.

- **Correlation Analysis:** A correlation test was performed between income and spending, revealing a positive correlation, confirming the hypothesis that higher income tends to lead to higher spending.

# Main Takeaways:
The data analysis highlighted key patterns in household shopping behavior, income distribution, and shopping methods.

While income and spending are correlated, the relationship does not appear to be strongly linear, suggesting other factors may influence spending.

Visualizations and statistical analysis were used effectively to represent complex data in a simple and engaging way for a broad audience.
