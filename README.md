# ðŸš€ R-Projects Repository
Welcome to R-Projects! This repository hosts multiple R projects, each designed to tackle different data analysis, visualization, or modeling challenges. Whether you're an R enthusiast or a data science professional, you'll find something valuable here!

# ðŸ“‚ Projects Overview
This repository contains the following projects:

**Project A** - This project analyzes Citi Bike ridership data from Q4 2016, exploring trip counts, rider demographics, bike usage patterns, and subscription types. It includes visualizations, statistical summaries, and insights into unusual values and trends in bike trips.

**Project B** - This project examines COVID-19 case and death data across NYC boroughs using ggplot2 for visualization. It includes summary statistics, time series analysis, and comparisons of infection rates, testing, and hospitalizations across different neighborhoods.

**Project C** - This project analyzes the 2019-20 Premier League season using R. It explores key statistics such as the number of teams and players, total goals scored, and attendance figures. It also identifies primary and foreign keys in the datasets, performs data cleaning, and visualizes relationships between team performance metrics, player statistics, and game outcomes.

**Project D** - This project conducts an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a manually created weekly shopping dataset. It summarizes key statistics of household spending, queue times, family sizes, and income levels. Using visualizations and hypothesis testing, it investigates relationships between income and spending patterns, the distribution of household sizes, and the impact of categorical variables on spending behavior.

**Project E** - This project simulates the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) using R. It generates random samples from a Poisson distribution, computes standardized sample means, and compares the empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF) with the theoretical normal distribution. The visualization demonstrates how sample means converge to a normal distribution as the sample size increases.
  
Each project has its own folder with a detailed README, data, and codebase.

# ðŸ“Œ About
This R project encompasses a comprehensive suite of data analysis and visualization tasks. It begins with data importation from various sources (CSV, Excel, databases, APIs), followed by extensive data cleaning and wrangling using packages like dplyr and tidyr. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted with summary statistics and visualizations via ggplot2 and plotly to uncover patterns and outliers. The project includes robust statistical analysis such as hypothesis testing, regression, and time series analysis. Interactive dashboards and reports are generated using Shiny and R Markdown to facilitate data storytelling. The project also involves connecting to databases, performing SQL queries, and ensuring reproducibility through documented workflows and version control with Git. Specialized analyses, such as bioinformatics and financial modeling, demonstrate the project's versatility, leveraging R's extensive ecosystem to deliver insightful and actionable results.

This repository is continuously updated with new projects and improvements. Feel free to contribute, fork, or reach out if you have questions!
